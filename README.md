## Hi there 👋

I'm Julilel, a student based in Germany.

I design and build whatever I can imagine, need or want.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll build it and ship it.

My main stack is Python, with a focus on agentic AI systems, local LLMs, Machine Learning, Data Science and retrieval-augmented generation.
