## Hi there 👋

I'm Julian, a student based in Germany.

I design and build projects driven by curiosity and concrete problems.
If an idea sticks, I usually turn it into something runnable.

My main stack is Python, with a focus on agentic AI systems, local LLMs,
machine learning, data-centric workflows, and retrieval-augmented generation.
